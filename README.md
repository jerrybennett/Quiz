Welcome!
You can use this Quiz template to create your own!
Just change the content of the "data-question" and "data-answer" for each 'class="question"' div appropriately for your usage.

Steps to view and edit:
1) Download the zip file for this repo.
2) Extract the zip file.
3) Go into the extracted file.
4) Right-click on the 'index.html' file and choose to open with a web browser.

I recommend using VSCode to make you edits.
Remember, after making changes to a file you need to save it and, either refresh the web page to see the changes, or use a VSCode extension like 'Live Preview' to see the changes you've made.
Please take some time to explore and refactor the code as you see fit.
Enjoy!
